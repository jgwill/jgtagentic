# Narrative Map

## Consolidation Overview

This branch merges insights from the recent codex feature branches:

1. **integrate-unified-alligator-cli-into-jgtagentic-2025-06-04-23-14-39** – introduced a unified CLI to run FDB scans and Alligator Illusion detection from one entry point.
2. **create-integration-plan-for-received-work-2025-06-06-17-17-09** – documented a phased approach for aligning received jgtml modules with jgtagentic.
3. **explore-samples-and-review-documentation-2025-06-09-11-34-19** – explored test samples and refined documentation around intent-driven trading.
4. **publish-relevant-content-using-tushell-2025-06-14-14-12-10** – leveraged tushell memory utilities to publish ledgers and share progress.

These branches culminate in the current **work** branch based on `main`, where Alligator Illusion Detection modules and enhanced FDB scanners are synchronized.

## Integration Plan

1. **Review jgtml Alligator modules**
   - `AlligatorIllusionDetector.py` and related scripts were cherry-picked for compatibility.
2. **Unify CLI entry points**
   - Ensure `jgtagenticcli.py` can invoke the detector and enhanced scanner seamlessly.
3. **Update documentation**
   - Integrate ledger summaries and docs from the four feature branches.
4. **Prepare future merges**
   - After testing, merge work branch back to `main` for a coherent history.

## Recent Timeline

- 2025‑06‑13: Updated Alligator Illusion Detection module documentation.
- 2025‑06‑13: Added Illusion Detection module code.
- 2025‑06‑12: Refactored observation capture for improved analysis.
- 2025‑06‑06: Integration success report for intent-driven automation.

This consolidation ensures that CLI tooling, documentation, and detection logic are ready for unified deployment.
