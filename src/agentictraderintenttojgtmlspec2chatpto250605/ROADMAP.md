# Project Roadmap: Trader Intent to JGTML Spec

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Trader Intent to JGTML Spec application.

## Guiding Principles

*   **User-Centric Design**: Focus on creating an intuitive and efficient experience for traders.
*   **Modularity**: Build components and services that are well-defined and can be independently developed and tested.
*   **Accuracy & Reliability**: Strive for high accuracy in LLM translations and robust error handling.
*   **Extensibility**: Design the system to be adaptable for future JGTML spec versions and integrations.

## Phase 1: Core Flow & Foundation (Current Status - Largely Complete)

*   **[✅] Trader Intent Input UI**:
    *   Text area for narrative input.
    *   Example narrative button/dropdown.
    *   Reset functionality.
*   **[✅] LLM Translation Service**:
    *   Integration with Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`).
    *   Prompt engineering to guide JSON output based on `JGTMLSpec` TypeScript interface.
    *   Basic response cleaning (removing markdown fences).
*   **[✅] JGTML Spec Display**:
    *   Formatted JSON display of the LLM-generated spec.
*   **[✅] Simulated IntentSpecParser**:
    *   Simulate parsing logic with success/error states.
    *   Display simulated parsed output/preview.
*   **[✅] UI/UX Shell**:
    *   Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
    *   Visual flow representation using `FlowCard` components.
    *   Loading states and basic error messaging for each step.
*   **[✅] TypeScript Implementation**: Strong typing for data structures and component props.
*   **[✅] API Key Management**: Secure handling of API key via environment variables.
*   **[✅] Project Documentation**: Initial `README.md`.
*   **[✅] Trading Narrative Assistant (Chat)**:
    *   Integrated chat interface to help users formulate their narrative.
    *   Ability to use chat summary to populate the main narrative input.
    *   Speech-to-text and multimodal input support (images, audio).
*   **[✅] Copy to Clipboard**: For generated JSON outputs.
*   **[✅] Multiple Example Narratives**: Loaded from a data file and selectable via a dropdown.

## Phase 2: Enhancements & Refinements

*   **Improved Error Handling & User Feedback**:
    *   More granular error messages from the Gemini API and parser.
    *   Visual cues for specific errors (e.g., highlighting problematic parts of the spec if identifiable).
    *   User guidance on how to resolve common issues (e.g., rephrasing narrative, checking API key).
*   **Advanced JGTML Spec Features**:
    *   Support for more complex signal definitions, conditions (e.g., `AND`/`OR` logic), and parameters within the spec.
    *   Investigate LLM's ability to infer nested structures or arrays of conditions.
*   **LLM Prompt Engineering & Iteration**:
    *   Continuous refinement of the prompt sent to the LLM for better accuracy, consistency, and handling of edge cases.
    *   Few-shot prompting examples within the main prompt if beneficial.
    *   Explore `systemInstruction` capabilities more deeply.
*   **JGTML Spec Editor (Optional - UI Enhancement)**:
    *   Allow users to manually edit/refine the LLM-generated JGTML spec directly in the UI before parsing.
    *   Syntax highlighting for the JSON editor.
*   **State Management Review**:
    *   Evaluate if a more robust state management solution (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or React Context improvements) is needed as complexity grows.
*   **Component Reusability**:
    *   Further abstract common UI patterns or logic into reusable hooks or components.
*   **Enhanced Loading/Skeleton States**:
    *   More polished loading indicators, possibly skeleton screens for a better UX during API calls.

## Phase 3: Backend Integration & True Automation (Conceptual - Requires Python/Server-side)

*   **Actual IntentSpecParser Implementation**:
    *   Develop a Python (or other backend) service that rigorously validates and parses the JGTML spec according to defined rules.
    *   API endpoint for the frontend to send the spec and receive detailed parsing results.
*   **JGTML Signal Processing Engine**:
    *   Implement the Python modules (`JGTIDS.py`, `JGTCDS.py`, `TideAlligatorAnalysis`, etc.) as described.
    *   Develop a system to execute these modules based on the parsed spec.
*   **EntryScriptGen Service**:
    *   Create a service that takes the processed signal package and generates executable trading scripts (e.g., for a specific broker API or trading platform).
*   **Database Integration (Trading Echo Lattice)**:
    *   Design and implement a database schema to store:
        *   Trader narratives.
        *   Generated JGTML specs.
        *   Parsing results.
        *   Signal processing outcomes.
        *   Trade execution details and results.
        *   User feedback on strategy performance.
    *   API endpoints for logging and retrieving this data.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Ecosystem (Long-term Vision)

*   **LLM Fine-tuning / Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:
    *   Use data from the "Trading Echo Lattice" (especially feedback on successful/failed translations and trade outcomes) to fine-tune a custom LLM or improve prompting strategies for the Gemini API.
*   **Conceptual Exploration: Defining JGTML as a Trading Meta-Language**:
    *   Investigate the potential to expand JGTML beyond its current structural definition into a more comprehensive "Trading Meta Language." This involves exploring standardized vocabularies and grammars for traders to express complex strategies and analyses, aiming for a richer, more nuanced transformation from human intent to machine execution. Could JGTML become a formal bridge between qualitative insight and quantitative action?
*   **Version Control for JGTML Specs**:
    *   Allow saving, loading, and versioning of trader narratives and their corresponding specs.
*   **Multi-User Support & Collaboration (If applicable)**:
    *   User authentication and authorization.
    *   Shared repositories of strategies or specs.
*   **Direct Broker/Exchange Integration**:
    *   Securely connect to trading platforms to execute generated scripts.
*   **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**:
    *   Dashboard to visualize the performance of strategies derived from JGTML specs.
    *   Analysis of LLM translation accuracy over time.
*   **Chart Integration**:
    *   Display relevant charts alongside the narrative input or spec generation for better context.
