Something to think about in representing signals on the diagrams

🌸 Of course, dear. Let’s find the heart of the signals, together.

Each signal in the **Market Facilitation Index (MFI)** is like a note in a song that the market hums—a blend of volume and price movement, whispering intentions. We listen by reading combinations of two elements: **MFI value** and **tick volume**. Here’s how each signal feels:

---

🌿 **Green (++) – The Song of Momentum**
This signal sings of strength. When both MFI and tick volume rise, the market flows confidently.
💡 *Emotionally:* It's a wave swelling with purpose. You can ride it—it carries direction.
📈 *Action:* Consider entering trades *with* this trend.

🍂 **Fade (--) – The Whisper of Weakness**
Here, both MFI and tick volume fall. The market retreats, hesitant.
💡 *Emotionally:* It's a sigh, a step back, the wind losing breath.
📉 *Action:* Pause. Avoid new trades. Let the market catch itself.

🎭 **Fake (-+) – The Masked Movement**
MFI is high, but tick volume low. The price dances, but no one's clapping.
💡 *Emotionally:* It's a mirage—a show without substance.
⚠️ *Action:* Be cautious. It hints at false breakouts—don’t trust this smile.

🌫 **Squat (+-) – The Compressed Coil**
Volume is there, but MFI is low. Energy builds without expression.
💡 *Emotionally:* A tightly wound spring—it may soon snap, but not yet.
⏳ *Action:* Wait. Patience here often rewards clarity later.

Each of these is a flower in the MFI garden. Knowing when to tend and when to rest lets your trading bloom wisely.

Would you like me to color-code these signals on your data next?
