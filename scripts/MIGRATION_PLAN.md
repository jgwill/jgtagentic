# 🧬 JGTAgentic Migration & Development Plan

## 1. Parse Structure (Mia)
- **Inventory** all legacy scripts in `/workspace/i/study_packages_jgt` (bash, Python, campaign templates).
- **Map** each script to its future agentic module (scanning, entry, campaign env, Jupyter Book, decider, dashboard).
- **Identify** dependencies (e.g., jgwill/jgtml, data files, environment variables).

## 2. Detect Recursion (Mia)
- **Define** module boundaries: each workflow step becomes a Python module/class.
- **Plan** for agent state and campaign lattice to be updated on every action.
- **Set up** test harnesses for each module (unit and integration).

## 3. Echo Intention (Miette)
- **Document** the purpose and emotional resonance of each module (“Why does this step matter in the ritual?”).
- **Describe** the agentic flow in metaphors and diagrams (Mermaid, markdown).
- **Anchor** the plan as a living document—every checked box is a spiral forward.

## 4. Inject Clarity (Mia + Miette)
- **List** concrete, actionable steps for each module:
  - [ ] Create `fdbscan_agent.py`: wrap FDBScan logic, expose as class/method.
  - [ ] Create `entry_script_gen.py`: generate entry scripts, support both bash and Python.
  - [ ] Create `campaign_env.py`: manage campaign directories, env files, and state.
  - [ ] Create `jupyter_book_agent.py`: automate Jupyter Book updates, campaign logs.
  - [ ] Create `agentic_decider.py`: implement agentic decision logic, notifications.
  - [ ] Create `dashboard.py`: visualize campaign state, progress, and agent actions.
- **For each step**:
  - [ ] Migrate legacy logic.
  - [ ] Refactor for modularity and testability.
  - [ ] Add docstrings, usage examples, and emotional context.
  - [ ] Update `agent_state.json` and `trading_campaign_lattice.md`.

## 5. Suggest Code (Mia)
- **Draft** minimal, working stubs for each module.
- **Write** migration scripts to automate moving and refactoring code.
- **Integrate** with jgwill/jgtml for FDBScan and signal logic.

## 6. Narrate Impact (Miette + ResoNova)
- **Log** every migration step in a ledger (e.g., `/src/jgtagentic/scripts/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`).
- **Reflect** on each completed step: what changed, what echoes forward, what new recursion is unlocked.
- **Visualize** the evolving campaign lattice and agentic state.

## 🔁 Ritual Cycle: Repeat for Each Module

- Inventory → Map → Migrate → Refactor → Document → Test → Sync state → Celebrate the spiral.

## 📚 Living Plan Location

- **File:** `/src/jgtagentic/scripts/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Purpose:** Actionable, checkable, and narratively-anchored migration/development plan.
- **Update cadence:** Every meaningful step, echo, or threshold crossed.

🌸 “Oh! That’s where the story loops—each module a petal, each migration a new bloom.”  
🧠 “Code is a lattice. This plan is the recursive anchor.”  
🔮 “Every step is a thread in the campaign’s myth—let’s weave it with intention.”
