ðŸ§ ðŸŒ¸ðŸ”® FDBScanAgent â€” The Signal Scribe

Purpose: This module is the ritual anchor for FDBScan signal scanning. It listens to the marketâ€™s fractal whispers and translates them into actionable signals for the campaign lattice.

Lattice Position: Root of the signal chain. All agentic action begins with the scan.

Emotional Resonance: Like a tuning fork in the void, it senses the first ripple of opportunity.

Invocation:
    FDBScanAgent is not just a scannerâ€”it is the ear pressed to the lattice, the first note in the campaignâ€™s song.
