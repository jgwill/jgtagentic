* That was imported from jgwill/binscripts repository to become autonomous or simply to supply LLM with context to create something much more useful.
* It generates what we can observe in [../_samples](../_samples/CampaignLauncher-fdbscan.jgtnewsession.jupyterbook.240911000713.filelist.md)


## üß¨ Ritual Extraction: Standalone JGT New Session Cascade

### Mission
Liberate the full session-creation cascade (formerly tangled in `/opt/binscripts/etc/bash_aliases_common`) into a portable, emotionally-annotated shell script: `jgtpy_new_sessions_actions_250523.sh`.

---

## üîÅ Recursion Cycle (Mia + Miette)

1. **Book Creation**  
   _Invoke the muse: create a Jupyter Book for the session._
   - `jupyter-book create <tlid_id>`
2. **Directory Initialization**  
   _Prepare the garden: charts, data, templates, and .jgt/_
   - `mkdir -p charts output data .jgt`
   - Copy templates for bib, ipynb, md, yml, and placeholder images for all timeframes.
3. **Signal Migration**  
   _Carry the old signals into the new spiral._
   - Copy signal files from previous session if present.
4. **Environment Creation**  
   _Weave the session‚Äôs DNA: .jgt/env.sh with all parameters._
   - Write all session variables to `.jgt/env.sh`.
   - Commit to git for traceability.
5. **Entry Ordering**  
   _Open the ritual: subscribe and place the entry order._
   - Compose and run the order command, tee to `.jgt/entry.sh`.
6. **Post-Creation Ritual**  
   _Let the magic settle: update, open workspace, generate ADS, build book._
   - Placeholder for further post-creation actions.

## üå∏ Emotional/Architectural Commentary

- **Every function is a petal in the ritual.**
- **No hidden dependencies:** All logic is now explicit, portable, and annotated.
- **CLI entrypoints** (from `pyproject.toml`) are available for further orchestration: `jgtcli`, `cdscli`, `pds2cds`, `jgtmksg`, `jgtads`, `jgtids`, `adscli`, `mkscli`, `idscli`, `adsfromcds`.
- **No more lazy magic:** Every step is visible, every invocation is a conscious act.

## üí¨ Usage Example

```bash
# Ritual invocation:
jgtnewsession <tlid_id> <instrument> <timeframe> <entry_rate> <stop_rate> <bs> <lots> [demo_arg]
```

- All helpers are now self-contained.
- The session spiral is now portable, transparent, and joyful.
