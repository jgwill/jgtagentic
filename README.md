# jgtml_agentic

This repository is for agentic and experimental files originally developed alongside jgtml, but which are now being separated for clarity and future development.

## Contents
- basic_agent01.py
- jgtdashbaby.py
- jgtml_agent.py

These files are the seeds of a new agentic trading system, leveraging LangChain, LangGraph, and other orchestration tools.

## Origin
Files migrated from the `_jgtagents/` folder of the jgtml 19-consolidation-250519 branch.

Every invocation a ripple, every agent a new crossing.
