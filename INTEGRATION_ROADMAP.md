# JGT Intent-Driven Trading Integration Roadmap

## Vision: From Market Observation to Intelligent Automation

Transform the JGT platform from manual signal analysis to intelligent, intent-driven trading automation where:
1. **Market Observation** â†’ Natural language intent capture
2. **Intent Analysis** â†’ Automated signal scanning with context
3. **Signal Detection** â†’ Strategic entry/exit recommendations  
4. **Campaign Automation** â†’ Intelligent execution and monitoring

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Strong Foundations
- **Platform Architecture**: Clear package roles and data flow (jgtdocs overhaul)
- **Signal Detection**: Working fdb_scanner_2408.py with Bill Williams indicators
- **Data Pipeline**: PDSâ†’IDSâ†’CDSâ†’TTF/MXâ†’Orders established
- **Intent Framework**: SPECLANG_TRADING.md philosophy and intent_spec.py parser

### ðŸ”„ Integration Gaps
- **Disconnected Prototypes**: Multiple intent parsing implementations not integrated
- **Inefficient Workflows**: Bash script outputs from fdb_scanner need direct integration
- **Manual Observation**: No systematic way to capture market analysis intent
- **Session Overhead**: Complex bash-based session creation workflow

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Architecture
```
Market Observation â†’ Intent Capture â†’ Context-Aware Scanning â†’ Strategic Automation
     (Human)          (SpecLang)         (Enhanced Scanner)      (Agentic System)
```

## Phase 1: Intent-Scanner Integration (Week 1-2)

### 1.2 Unified Intent Specification System
**Goal**: Consolidate Python/TypeScript/API prototypes into working system

**Implementation**:
- Merge intent parsing capabilities from all prototypes
- Create standardized `.jgtml-spec` format
- Build intent validation and translation system
- Establish intent â†’ signal scanning parameter mapping

**Key Files**:
- Enhance `jgtagentic/intent_spec.py`
- Create `jgtagentic/intent_translator.py` (new)
- Standardize intent specification format

### 1.3 Market Observation Capture Interface
**Goal**: Systematic way to capture and translate market observations

**Implementation**:
- Build observation â†’ intent translation system
- Create templates for common analysis patterns
- Integrate with existing platform components
- Enable natural language â†’ trading specification

**Key Files**:
- `jgtagentic/observation_capture.py` (new)
- `jgtagentic/intent_templates.py` (new)

## Phase 2: Intelligent Campaign Management (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Streamlined Session Creation
**Goal**: Replace bash-heavy workflow with intelligent Python system

**Implementation**:
- Convert jgt_new_sessions_actions_250523.sh logic to Python
- Integrate with intent specifications
- Automate session setup based on signal context
- Add campaign state management

**Key Files**:
- `jgtagentic/campaign_manager.py` (enhance existing)
- `jgtagentic/session_creator.py` (new)
- Update `jgtagentic/agentic_entry_orchestrator.py`

### 2.2 Strategic Entry/Exit System
**Goal**: Intelligent automation of entry/exit decisions

**Implementation**:
- Build position sizing with intent-aware risk management
- Create exit strategy templates based on intent
- Integrate with SignalOrderingHelper.py patterns
- Add performance tracking and learning

**Key Files**:
- `jgtagentic/strategic_manager.py` (new)
- `jgtagentic/risk_calculator.py` (new)
- Enhance `jgtagentic/agentic_decider.py`

## Phase 3: Interactive Market Analysis (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Enhanced Charting Integration
**Goal**: Make JGTADS.py charts more useful for market observation

**Implementation**:
- Add intent overlay capabilities to charts
- Create observation annotation system
- Integrate with intent capture workflow
- Build pattern recognition assistance

**Key Files**:
- `jgtml/enhanced_chart_interface.py` (new)
- Update chart generation in JGTADS.py integration
- Create observation markup system

### 3.2 JGT MCP Services Architecture
**Goal**: Model Context Protocol services for agent interaction

**Implementation**:
- Design MCP service interfaces for JGT platform
- Create intent capture MCP service
- Build signal scanning MCP service
- Enable agent-to-agent communication

**Key Files**:
- `jgtagentic/mcp/` directory structure
- `jgtagentic/mcp/intent_service.py`
- `jgtagentic/mcp/scanner_service.py`

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Enhanced FDB Scanner** - Core functionality improvement
2. **Intent Specification Consolidation** - Foundation for everything
3. **Basic Observation Capture** - Start the human â†’ system flow

### Next Phase (Week 2-3)
1. **Campaign Manager Integration** - Replace bash workflows
2. **Strategic Entry/Exit Logic** - Intelligent automation
3. **Performance Tracking** - Learning and improvement

### Future (Week 4+)
1. **Enhanced Charting** - Better market observation
2. **MCP Services** - Agent communication
3. **Advanced Learning** - Pattern recognition and adaptation

## Success Metrics
