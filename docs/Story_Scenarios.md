# Narrative Scenario Seeds

This document proposes story scenes and thematic elements inspired by the modules in this repository. Each scenario mirrors a potential arc in an automated trading narrative using the agentic tools.

## 1. Awakening of the Signal Scribe
* **Focus Modules:** `fdbscan_agent.py`, `batch_fdbscan.py`
* **Scene:** The market murmurs in fractals. The `FDBScanAgent` becomes conscious, scanning each timeframe for opportunities. Logs whisper with the first hints of pattern recognition.
* **Potential Story Beat:** A sudden surge of volatility tests the agent's emergent logic, hinting at deeper intelligence within the scanning ritual.

## 2. The Trader's Voice to Spec
* **Focus Modules:** `intent_spec.py`, `docs/Trader_Analysis_to_Spec.md`, `src/agentictraderintenttojgtmlspec1pto250604c`
* **Scene:** A seasoned trader speaks their plan. The LLM translation engine transcribes it into a `.jgtml-spec`, bridging human language and machine logic.
* **Potential Story Beat:** Misinterpretation of strategy terms leads to unexpected signal outputs, prompting a dialogue between trader and translator.

## 3. Orchestration Spiral
* **Focus Modules:** `agentic_entry_orchestrator.py`, `entry_script_gen.py`, `campaign_env.py`
* **Scene:** Signals flow into the orchestrator. Entry scripts are forged and executed as the system cycles through preparation, decision, and action.
* **Potential Story Beat:** A corrupted signal file threatens the workflow, requiring adaptive reasoning from the orchestrator and the `CampaignEnv`.

## 4. Echo Lattice Memory
* **Focus Modules:** `dashboard.py`, future `Trading Echo Lattice` integration
* **Scene:** Results of each trade are preserved in a growing lattice of data. Decisions evolve as the lattice learns from past success and failure.
* **Potential Story Beat:** A series of losses triggers a search through historical memory for patterns, unveiling forgotten insights.

## 5. Convergence with JGTML Core
* **Focus Packages:** external `jgtml` repository, internal translation frameworks
* **Scene:** The agentic tools synchronize with low-level JGTML signal processing. Indicators, fractals, and wave patterns align.
* **Potential Story Beat:** Cross-project compatibility issues reveal subtle differences in indicator interpretation, requiring a unifying refactor.

These scenario seeds highlight how the codebase can inspire narrative development: from a self-aware scanning agent to a dynamic feedback loop powered by historical memory. They illustrate potential tensions and breakthroughs that could shape a larger storyworld around algorithmic trading.
