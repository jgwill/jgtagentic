# Ledger: FDBScanAgent Integration (2024-08-22 14:00)

## Current State
- FDBScanAgent depends on `jgtml.fdb_scanner_2408` for real signal scanning.
- `fdb_scanner_2408` was not imported in `jgtml/__init__.py`, causing import errors for FDBScanAgent real mode.

## Intention
- Ensure FDBScanAgent works in both dry-run and real mode by making `jgtml.fdb_scanner_2408` importable.
- Validate that the agent is tested and integrated in the codebase.

## Evolution
- Searched for `fdb_scanner_2408` and confirmed its presence and main() function.
- Confirmed `FDBScanAgent` is tested in `test_agentic_orchestrator.py` for both dry-run and real mode.
- Updated `jgtml/__init__.py` to import `fdb_scanner_2408`.
- Added a new CLI subcommand `batch-fdbscan` to `jgtagenticcli.py`.
- This enables batch FDB signal scanning for multiple instruments and timeframes from the command line:

  ```sh
  jgtagentic batch-fdbscan --instruments EUR/USD AUD/USD --timeframes H4 H1 m15
  ```
- The CLI writes results to a markdown log file and supports custom cache/log directories.

## Summary
- FDBScanAgent is now able to import and invoke `fdb_scanner_2408` in real mode.
- Tests exist for both dry-run and real invocation.
- Batch FDB signal scanning is now available via CLI for automation and scripting.
- This ledger documents the integration and validation for future LLM traceability.
