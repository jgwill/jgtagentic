## 📝 ITERATION LOG

### 2025-01-01 19:00 - Phase 3 Initiation
- Phase 2 successfully completed with full operational capability
- Created Phase 3 roadmap for environment optimization
- Identified priority areas for enhancement
- Ready to begin environment optimization work

---

### 2025-01-01 19:00-19:10 - Environment Optimization SUCCESS
- ✅ Diagnosed NumPy/PyArrow compatibility issue
- ✅ Identified PyArrow 14.0.2 was compiled against NumPy 1.x
- ✅ Upgraded PyArrow from 14.0.2 → 20.0.0
- ✅ **ALL NumPy compatibility warnings ELIMINATED**
- ✅ System now runs completely clean without errors/warnings
- ✅ Multi-timeframe analysis confirmed stable and accurate

### EUR-USD Multi-Timeframe Test Results (D1, H1, H4):
- 4 FDB signals detected across timeframes
- 1 sophisticated illusion detected (weak H4 signal: 0.046% mouth separation)
- Quality score: 7.00/10 (appropriately reduced due to illusion)
- Recommendation: PROCEED WITH CAUTION (intelligent risk assessment)
- **Perfect demonstration of nuanced analysis capabilities**
