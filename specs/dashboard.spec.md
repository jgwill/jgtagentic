# Dashboard Specification

## Purpose

`Dashboard` provides a visual overview of campaign status and agent actions. It aggregates signals, decisions, and logs into a coherent display for traders.

## Key Behaviors

- Accept campaign data dictionaries and render a summary view.
- Intended to show metrics like number of signals processed, decision outcomes, and environment status.
- Currently a placeholder to be expanded with web or console-based rendering.

## Integration Notes

- Will consume data generated by the orchestrator and FTS databases.
- Should eventually integrate with the React-based prototype under `agentictraderintenttojgtmlspec2chatpto250605` for a unified UI.
- Key metrics from this dashboard feed into the Trading Echo Lattice for continuous learning.
