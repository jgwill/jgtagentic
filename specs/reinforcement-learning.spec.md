# Reinforcement Learning Integration Plan

Outlines how reinforcement learning components from the FTS repository should be merged into `jgtagentic`.

## Expected Deliverables

- RL agent code for signal validity tracking and parameter optimization.
- Reward functions based on trade outcomes.
- Training scripts and configuration files.

## Integration Steps

1. **Package Structure**
   - Create `src/ftsrl/` for RL agents and utilities.
   - Provide an entrypoint CLI `fts-rl-train` for training routines.

2. **Dependencies**
   - Expect frameworks such as `torch` or `tensorflow`; list them under optional extras in `pyproject.toml`.
   - Include environment configuration samples for GPU usage.

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests in `tests/ftsrl/` ensuring reward logic and training loops run in dry mode.
   - Provide sample runs that use small datasets for CI validation.

4. **Collaboration Notes**
   - Align RL state representations with the database schema from `src/ftsds/data/export-FTSKnower23/FTS_Today_231114e_Use_Cases___Leveraging.md`.
   - Document training workflows within Jupyter Book with code snippets.
